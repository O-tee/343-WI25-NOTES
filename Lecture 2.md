### Trees
Terms
- Node
- Branch (edge)
- Parent, child, siblings
- Ancestor, descendant
- Height (many definitions): maximal level of any node
  -  If root as level 0, height of this tree: 3
  -  If root as level 1, height of this tree: 4
- Can be defined using a recursive definition.
  â€“ T is a tree if:
    - T is empty, or
    - T has a node and zero or more non-empty subtrees (each of which is also a tree.)
